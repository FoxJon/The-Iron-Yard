#APP Research

##1. Redfin##
* This app is loaded with navigation buttons. There is so much going on in this app that sometimes it is hard to tell what is clickable and what isn't. There are some obvious nav buttons on the home page, but once you get into it you can really get a bit overwhelmed by all the navigation options. Some of the buttons take you out of the app, which is a bit annoying. Would be nice to have an alert to say you are bout to leave the app. I noticed that there are a few buttons that are really small, but they compensated for this by making the area around it active as well.
* The overall look of the app is a bit generic. The background is a little plain and the buttons are very square and generic.
* This nicest part of this app is all the pictures. They all seem to stream very quickly without lag. My favorite feature of this app is that it locates houses for sale around you. So if you are walking down the street and see a house for sale, you can open up this app and see the house at the top of the home page. Just click on it, and you'll see the asking price and all the pictures of the inside plus all the other fine details. Pretty cool. Searching for homes is also pretty easy and straightforward. 
* One big problem I found is that I was unable to find a way to update/change my e-mail.

##2. Urbanspoon##
* First impression, pleasant to look at. The pictures are nice and I like the way you can scroll through them, but there was a bit of lag in the load time. Going to the app for the first time, it's not totally clear where to start, but after some clicking around it's pretty easy to figure out. All the buttons are clearly marked and easy to find. I like how the map opens and closes within the app and you can open it in a small window or expand it to the full page. 
* The flow is nice in that you can click in the pictures that highlight various categories and instantly see where they are located on the map as well as quick information about pricing and user reviews. Everything is very intuitive.
* I was unable to sign up with a bad email. The screen just resets, but there is no alert to tell you that you entered something improperly.
* I like the transparent background on the labels. I like that the buttons highlight when you click them. I like that they rounded the corners on their buttons.

##3. Groupon##
* First time coming to this app, they try to get you to sign in right away with Facebook or sign up with Groupon. There is an option to skip at the bottom of the page though.
* Upon entering the sight, the color scheme is not my favorite. It's a green header and a white body with pictures. Under the picture is a label with some minor information, but the label is almost the same color as the background. A little more contrast would be nice. I don't feel very inspired by this app. There is a "G" tab at the bottom that is always there. Though it is interesting, I don't really like the placement of it. It just seems to be in the way. 
* Clicking on the map does a "flip" transition. It feels a little abrupt compared to the rest of the app. I like that I can swipe left and right to navigate through the various topics.
* The reserve a table function is cool. Uses a similar "slot machine" function as the alarm clock on the iPhone to select the various choices. I like the color scheme here better too.
* If you go to the "G" at the bottom and touch reservations and then tap the "sign up" button at the bottom, you'll see another "flip" transition. The speed at which this flips is much nicer than the one I mentioned above. 
* Not too many buttons on this one. Mostly clicking pictures, a few clickable arrows and "buy" buttons.

##4. AroundMe##
* Opening this one up, it took a minute for it to load. It was just a blank white page for about 5 seconds. Maybe a loading icon would have been nice.
* It's very simple looking. White background with solid round buttons in different colors and a white silhouette icon in the middle of the button. Easy to find settings and location finder right at the top. Option to change view from list to grid. 
* Has option to get directions using other third party maps like Apple Maps or Waze.
* Has a very interesting search feature that lets you look around through your camera and you can see labels of what you are looking for pop up in the screen base on the direction you are looking. Unfortunately, this feature is not easy to find. This is what makes this app unique and it should definitely be more prominent.
* As with most of these apps, it has the square with the up arrow icon that opens up a window for sending message, mail or Facebook. You can also AirDrop or copy the address on this page.

##5. Redbox##
* This app had a landing page right away with a loading wheel while it loaded up the data.
* Has a side panel menu that is easy to find. Setting location is at the bottom of the screen and easy to find.
* Everything is pretty intuitive and easy to find with the exception of the filter feature. It's not super clear that it is a button. It says that it is filtering, but it doesn't look like a button. Clicking on it opens up the filter preferences. After clicking on your filter preferences, there is a small blue word up at the top that says "Apply". I think this would have been better to be a larger button at the bottom part of the screen as opposed to a clickable word. There is also no back button on this screen so you have to select "apply" to get out of this screen.
* Has a "Play Trailer" button that links to a quicktime movie.
* Fairly simple color scheme of red header and footer with white body and pictures in the middle. Has two rectangle buttons with rounded corners at the top with a grey background. Button is either clear or blue when selected.

##6. Belly##
* This app is fairly basic looking. Not much color. Mostly white background with a blue header and some icons down the left side. The main buttons are rectangles with data inside them. There is an arrow on the right side to indicate that these are buttons, but you can click anywhere within the rectangle. It has a QR code button that is very easy to find. It's a red tab drawer at the bottom that slides up when you press it. The icon then changes to a down arrow to indicate it is ready to slide back down when you are done scanning.
* There is a "Get Pass" button that is a little hard to find. But touching that button adds the store to your Apple Passbook.  

##7. Starbucks##
* The first time I opened up this app after the major update, I was at the cash register and couldn't figure out how to find my card that I wanted to pay with. Most of the buttons on the home page are just clickable words. The pay button I would think is the most important and it's just a tiny word up in the corner. When I touch that, my card pops up, but I have multiple cards and it took me a while to find them. You must swipe up on the screen to pull up another page that has a list of all your cards. This is not very intuitive and there is no indication on how to find them. There are four clear square buttons at the bottom that highlight when pressed. One button has scrolling text in it that is pretty cool. They went pretty dark on this version. Mostly a charcoal background with white text.
* After you get past the home screen, a lot of the navigation is just white rectangles with labels and a > to the right side. If there is no rectangle, it's just a clickable word with a > to the right of it.
* Found how to add a store to my Passbook by luck. It was buried fairly deep in the app.
* What would be nice is to have the location finder outside of the search window.It took me a minute to realize I had to click the Search Stores box to open up the current location clickable.

##8. Hipchat##
* Very generic looking home page. Basically just a list in black text on a white background. Blue header. Clickable rectangle buttons that go the width of the screen. The footer is transparent which I don't really care for. 
* It has a sliding panel on the left (like the Facebook app). This opens up the groups that you are enrolled in. Color scheme here is white text on grey rectangle buttons. Honestly I think they have it backwards here. I'd rather see the groups that I belong to right at the front and the sliding panel would have the other groups that I could join if I wish.
* If I go inside the side panel and click on my name, I get the settings. Wow, everything in here is _really_ **tiny!** It reminds me of when I would go to Yahoo on my phone and click desktop view. I don't think they optimized this page for mobile devices.
* Just found a feature by accident. If you go to the side panel and swipe left on one of the chats, a close button will appear. Only reason I found that is because I was trying to pull the panel shut.


##9. The Weather Channel##
* this is a nice looking app. The home page has a picture with text overlay. The buttons are easily identifiable. Three small white round buttons at the top with simple icons and four grey rectangle buttons below that with white text. The main center panel is swipe able with page indicators at the bottom. There are also 3 picture buttons at the bottom with small labels across the top of the button. 
* When you press the buttons across the top, there is a nice picture transition and the new information appears. Clicking on the information in the main body opens up a drop down window which is indicated by a plus sign to the right of the clickable data.
* There is a plus button in the center of the main page under the temperature information. Clicking this opens a nice window animation. A semi-transparent thick grey line shoots out to the right of the plus sign and then drop open to form a rectangle and the text fades in to fill the rectangle.
* If there is a weather alert, a tab with the style of alert will appear on the right. This tab slides open if you click on it. Has a < or > indicator depending on the position of state of the tab.
* The radar map has a flipped up corner that when touched, makes the map "flip" open so you can apply various filters for clouds, temp., rainfall, etc... Everything is clearly labeled with picture/text buttons. 
* Everything is very well laid out. Not too crowded and busy. Easily navigable. All the buttons and swipes are clear and do what I expect them to do.

##10. Waze##
* When the app opens up, it automatically shows your location. It's just a basic 3d view road map with two solid blue buttons with a solid white icon in the middle. Clicking the button opens up a pop-up menu. The menu has large square white buttons with colored icons. Also small round buttons with simple icons along the bottom for settings.
* Most of the buttons are either long white clickable rectangles with black text or large square buttons with a colorful icon in the middle. There are also back "<" and close "X" indicators at the top of each window for navigation. The flow is easy and intuitive.
* There is a speech to text feature for easy address entering.
* Once you start driving, the directions appear in a large rectangle window at the top. It's a semitransparent window with blue and white text.
* New windows are opened up by either pop-up windows or a slide transition.
* Everything is fairly well laid out and easy to find. Not too cluttered.
